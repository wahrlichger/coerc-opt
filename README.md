# Coerciveness of Function and Optimization Techniques

This repository contains MATLAB scripts for exploring the concept of coerciveness in functions and various optimization techniques.

## Description

The project includes scripts that generate plots and perform computations related to the coerciveness of functions and optimization techniques. The main focus is on understanding how coerciveness affects the performance of different optimization algorithms.

## Scripts

### contour_plot.m

This script generates a contour plot of the function `f(x_1, x_2) = x_1^4 - 4x_1x_2 + x_2^4`. The function is plotted over the range `-2 <= x_1, x_2 <= 2` with a step size of `0.01`.

## Usage

To run the scripts, you need MATLAB installed on your machine. Open the script in MATLAB and run the script.
